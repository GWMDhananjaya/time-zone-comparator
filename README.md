    <h1>🚀 My First Next.js Project – Time Zone Comparator 🌐</h1>

    <p>I’m thrilled to share my first <strong>Next.js</strong> project! 🎉</p>

    <p>As a freelancer working with clients across different time zones, scheduling meetings can be challenging. To solve this, I built a <strong>Time Zone Comparator</strong> web app.</p>

    <h2>🌍 What This App Does</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✔ Select two countries 🗺</li>
        <li>✔ Enter a meeting time 🕒</li>
        <li>✔ Instantly convert and display the corresponding time in the other country 📅</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔥 Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>✅ <strong>Accurate time conversion</strong> between multiple countries</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Supports various time zones</strong> for seamless scheduling</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Built with Next.js</strong> for performance and scalability</li>
        <li>✅ <strong>Styled with Tailwind CSS</strong> for a sleek and responsive UI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project has not only streamlined my meeting scheduling but also allowed me to explore <strong>Next.js</strong> in a real-world application. I’m excited to use it in my freelancing journey!</p>

    <p>📌 <em>Looking forward to building more awesome projects like this!</em></p>
